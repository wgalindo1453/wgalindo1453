## ‚ö° Fun Fact

I'm the proud owner of a personal zoo, which includes 1 German Shepherd, 1 Great Pyrenees, 1 Tabby Cat, and 4 Goldfish. They're all part of my debugging team when I code. And guess what? The cat's solutions usually work!

With a solid foundation in Computer Science from The University of Texas at San Antonio, where I earned my B.S., my journey in tech has been both broad and deep. I bring a wealth of experience from FrogTutoring, where I passionately guide students through the complexities of programming, databases, and application development. My academic path has also seen me contribute as a research and teaching assistant, focusing on innovative data extraction methods from public repositories and exploring the potentials of cloud computing.

Before embarking on my tech career, I served in the US Marine Corps, where I honed my leadership and discipline as a drill instructor and aviation maintenance supervisor. These experiences have instilled in me a unique blend of rigor, management skills, and technical prowess.

Currently, I am embracing the role of a software developer at JenesisSoftware, where I am committed to driving innovation and growth. Alongside my professional endeavors, I remain a devoted tutor at FrogTutoring, fueled by a love for learning and empowering students. My expertise spans a wide array of languages and technologies, including web development, Android development, and desktop applications. What sets me apart is not just my proficiency in these areas but my adaptability, attention to detail, and humility in tackling the various challenges that each project brings.

As I continue my education in Computer Science, my journey is characterized by perpetual learning, teaching, and the development of innovative solutions that make a difference.
