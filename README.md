### Hi there, I'm [William Galindo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-g-51b01775/) üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Texas at San Antonio](https://www.utsa.edu/). My research journey has led me to focus on the intricacies of cloud computing and serverless computing performance - areas where I believe innovation and enhancement are pivotal.

Beyond academia, I have a passion for sharing knowledge and insights with others. I take great pleasure in tutoring various computer science courses through [frogtutor.com](https://frogtutoring.com/tutor/TX/San_Antonio/111687). Not only does this allow me to contribute to the learning journeys of aspiring programmers, but it also keeps me sharp across various programming languages. Each tutoring session brings new challenges that inspire me to stay at the forefront of emerging trends and technologies.


## üß† My Research Interest

- **Cloud Computing:** I am particularly interested in exploring the capabilities of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform to build scalable and resilient applications. I am also interested in researching the security and privacy implications of cloud computing and exploring ways to mitigate them.
- **Serverless Computing Performance:** I am interested in researching the performance of serverless functions on cloud platforms, and finding ways to make it more transparent to developers when using AWS and Google Cloud services. My goal is to help developers optimize their serverless applications for performance and cost-effectiveness.

## ‚ö° Fun fact 

- I'm the proud owner of a personal zoo at home, which includes 1 German Shepherd, 1 Great Pyrenees, 1 Tabby Cat, and 4 Goldfish. They're all part of my debugging team when I code. And guess what? The cat's solutions usually work!
